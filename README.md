The River & Floodgate Monitoring System is an automated solution designed to monitor environmental conditions such as water level and rainfall in real time to prevent flooding and manage water resources efficiently.
It uses sensors like water level sensors and rainfall sensors to collect environmental data, which is processed by an embedded ESP32 controller.
A limit switch is integrated to detect the position of the floodgate, confirming whether it is fully open or closed, which ensures accurate gate operation.
When predefined thresholds are reached, actuators such as electric motors are triggered to open or close the gates. An alarm and LED light are also used to alert nearby communities in case of danger.
The system connects to a web-based IoT dashboard that displays real-time data, sends alerts, and enables remote monitoring and control. This allows authorities to respond quickly and make informed decisions.
